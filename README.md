# The geopolitical risk spillovers across BRICS countries: A quantile frequency connectedness approach
## <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/sjpe.12355">Published in Scottish Journal of Political Economy</a>

### Brief description
- This paper investigates the geopolitical risk spillovers among BRICS countries during the 1985â€“2022 period. 
- We adopt the novel quantile frequency connectedness approach, which allows us to examine the risk transmission by frequency and quantile.
- Published in Scottish Journal of Political Economy (an **A-ranked** journal)


### Technical skills used in this project
- Cleaned and transformed data, and perform the unit root tests using **Stata**
- Utilized **R Studio** to analyze the quantile frequency connectedness of the geopolitical risk among BRICS countries as well as to plot figures of quantile spillover effects
